Each pushbutton is wired on one end to 3.3v
As far as the other end of the button:
#1 - GPIO 48
#2 - GPIO 38
#3 - GPIO 39
#4 - GPIO 40

The encoder is wired to 3.3v and then
CLK - GPIO 37
DT - GPIO 36

// SD and LCD both hooked to SPI #0
MOSI - GPIO 7
MISO - GPIO 10
CLK - GPIO 6

// the remaining LCD pins are as follows
CS - GPIO 5
DC - GPIO 4
RST - GPIO 8
BL - 3.3v

// the remaining SD pins are as follows
CS - GPIO 11
